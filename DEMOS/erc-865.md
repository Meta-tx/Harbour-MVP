# ERC-865

**Short paragraph on where your team is at...**:

ERC-865 is an extension to the ERC-20 token standard that adds support for making transfers and approvals using meta transactions. It is built directly into the token, rather than requiring a proxy contract. It was initally put forward as part of the PROPS token, and was adopted by a few other projects such as Coinvest. However, it was never finalized, so we would like to work with the rest of the community to create a standard for "meta tokens" that is interoperable with other forms of meta transactions.

## TX Format 

    function transferPreSigned(
        bytes _signature,
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        uint256 _fee,
        uint256 _nonce
    )
        public
        returns (bool)
    {
        require(_to != address(0));
        require(signatures[_signature] == false);

        bytes32 hashedTx = transferPreSignedHashing(address(this), _to, _value, _fee, _nonce);

        address from = recover(hashedTx, _signature);
        require(from != address(0));

        balances[from] = balances[from].sub(_value).sub(_fee);
        balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(_value);
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].add(_fee);
        signatures[_signature] = true;

        Transfer(from, _to, _value);
        Transfer(from, msg.sender, _fee);
        TransferPreSigned(from, _to, msg.sender, _value, _fee);
        return true;
    }

## Hashing Format 

    function transferPreSignedHashing(
        address _token,
        address _to,
        uint256 _value,
        uint256 _fee,
        uint256 _nonce
    )
        public
        pure
        returns (bytes32)
    {
        /* "48664c16": transferPreSignedHashing(address,address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256) */
        return keccak256(bytes4(0x48664c16), _token, _to, _value, _fee, _nonce);
    }
