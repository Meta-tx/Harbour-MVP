# meta-transaction-format-share

[EIP-1077](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1077.md) is a very good guideline for how to format your meta transactions, but we are finding that different organizations have different use-cases. We would like to start executing transactions for each other but we need a centralized place to facilitate sharing our current implementations.

Let's all post our meta transaction formats here in a digestible format:  

### Format 
```
{
  This is the format of my meta transaction 
}
```

### Rx 
```
{
  Here is my (pseudo?)code for getting transactions from my dapp
}
```

### Tx
```
{
  Here is my (pseudo?)code for getting transactions on chain
}
```
